# S3 mock library for Java/Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/findify/s3mock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/findify/s3mock)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.findify/s3mock_2.12/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.findify/s3mock_2.12)

s3mock is a web service implementing AWS S3 API, which can be used for local testing of your code using S3
but without hitting real S3 endpoints.

Implemented API methods:
* list buckets
* list objects (all & by prefix)
* create bucket
* delete bucket
* put object (via PUT, POST, multipart and chunked uploads are also supported)
* copy object
* get object
* delete object
* batch delete

Not supported features (these might be implemented later):
* authentication: s3proxy will accept any credentials without validity and signature checking
* bucket policy, ACL, versioning
* object ACL
* posix-incompatible key structure with file-based provider, for example keys `/some.dir/file.txt` and `/some.dir` in the same bucket

## Installation

s3mock package is available for Scala 2.11/2.12 (on Java 8). To install using SBT, add these
 statements to your `build.sbt`:

    libraryDependencies += "io.findify" %% "s3mock" % "0.2.1" % "test",

On maven, update your `pom.xml` in the following way:
```xml
    // add this entry to <dependencies/>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.findify</groupId>
        <artifactId>s3mock_2.12</artifactId>
        <version>0.2.1</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
```
## Usage

Just point your s3 client to a localhost, enable path-style access, and it should work out of the box.

There are two working modes for s3mock:
* File-based: it will map a local directory as a regular s3 bucket. This mode can be useful when you need to have a bucket with some pre-loaded data.
* In-memory: keep everything in RAM. All the data you've uploaded to s3mock will be wiped completely on shutdown. 

Java:
```java
    import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSStaticCredentialsProvider;
    import com.amazonaws.auth.AnonymousAWSCredentials;
    import com.amazonaws.client.builder.AwsClientBuilder;
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Builder;
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client;
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder;
    import io.findify.s3mock.S3Mock;
    
    /*
     S3Mock.create(8001, "/tmp/s3");
     */
    S3Mock api = new S3Mock.Builder().withPort(8001).withInMemoryBackend().build();
    api.start();
            
    /* AWS S3 client setup.
     *  withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true) trick is required to overcome S3 default 
     *  DNS-based bucket access scheme
     *  resulting in attempts to connect to addresses like "bucketname.localhost"
     *  which requires specific DNS setup.
     */
    EndpointConfiguration endpoint = new EndpointConfiguration("http://localhost:8001", "us-west-2");
    AmazonS3Client client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder
      .standard()
      .withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true)  
      .withEndpointConfiguration(endpoint)
      .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(new AnonymousAWSCredentials()))     
      .build();

    client.createBucket("testbucket");
    client.putObject("testbucket", "file/name", "contents");
    api.stop();
```

Scala with AWS S3 SDK:
```scala
    import io.findify.s3mock.S3Mock
    import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSStaticCredentialsProvider
    import com.amazonaws.auth.AnonymousAWSCredentials
    import com.amazonaws.client.builder.AwsClientBuilder
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Builder
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client
    import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder
    import io.findify.s3mock.S3Mock

    
    /** Create and start S3 API mock. */
    val api = S3Mock(port = 8001, dir = "/tmp/s3")
    api.start

    /* AWS S3 client setup.
     *  withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true) trick is required to overcome S3 default 
     *  DNS-based bucket access scheme
     *  resulting in attempts to connect to addresses like "bucketname.localhost"
     *  which requires specific DNS setup.
     */
    val endpoint = new EndpointConfiguration("http://localhost:8001", "us-west-2")
    val client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder
      .standard
      .withPathStyleAccessEnabled(true)  
      .withEndpointConfiguration(endpoint)
      .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(new AnonymousAWSCredentials()))     
      .build

    /** Use it as usual. */
    client.createBucket("foo")
    client.putObject("foo", "bar", "baz")
```

Scala with Alpakka 0.8:
```scala
    import akka.actor.ActorSystem
    import akka.stream.ActorMaterializer
    import akka.stream.alpakka.s3.scaladsl.S3Client
    import akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink
    import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory
    import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

    val config = ConfigFactory.parseMap(Map(
      "akka.stream.alpakka.s3.proxy.host" -> "localhost",
      "akka.stream.alpakka.s3.proxy.port" -> 8001,
      "akka.stream.alpakka.s3.proxy.secure" -> false,
      "akka.stream.alpakka.s3.path-style-access" -> true
    ).asJava)
    implicit val system = ActorSystem.create("test", config)
    implicit val mat = ActorMaterializer()
    import system.dispatcher
    val s3a = S3Client()
    val contents = s3a.download("bucket", "key").runWith(Sink.reduce[ByteString](_ ++ _)).map(_.utf8String)
      
```
